Optional: IIFEs
In JavaScript - especially in older scripts - you sometimes find a pattern described as "IIFEs". IIFE stands for "Immediately Invoked Function Expression" and the pattern you might find looks like this (directly in a script file):

(function() {
    var age = 30;
    console.log(age); // 30
})()
 
console.log(age); // Error: "age is not defined"
What's that?

We see a function expression which calls itself (please note the () right after the function).

It's NOT a function declaration because it's wrapped in () - that happens on purpose since you can't immediately execute function declarations.

But why would you write some code?

Please note that the snippet uses var, NOT let or const. Remember that var does NOT use block scope but only differ between global and function scope.

As a consequence, it was hard to control where variables were available - variables outside of function always were available globally. Well, IIFEs solve that problem since the script (or parts of it) essentially are wrapped in a function => Function scope is used.

Nowadays, this is not really required anymore. With let and const we got block scope and if you want to restrict where variables are available (outside of functions, if statements, for loops etc - where you automatically have scoped variables since these structures create blocks), you can simply wrap the code that should have scoped variables with {}.

{
    const age = 30;
    console.log(age); // 30
}
 
console.log(age); // Error: "age is not defined"
Not something you see too often but something that is possible.
